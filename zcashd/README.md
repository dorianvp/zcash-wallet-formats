# Zcashd's `wallet.dat`

## Important Information

[ZIP-400](https://zips.z.cash/zip-0400) documents the schema used for zcashd `v3.0.0-rc1`. Since then, the format has changed a bit.
[This issue](https://github.com/zcash/zips/issues/964) also tracks ZIP-400's update.

## Background

> The following text is taken from [this wallet guide for exchanges](https://hackmd.io/@daira/rJVEmOCkh).
> Read through to learn more about changes accross versions.

The `zcashd` internal wallet was, as with the rest of zcashd, forked from Bitcoin code in May 2015.
The original design of the wallet treated all transparent addresses in the wallet as receiving funds into
a single "bucket of money" from which spends could be made. In this original design, individual addresses were not
treated as having individual, distinguishable balances (even though such per-address balances were representable
at the protocol layer). This single "bucket" of transparent funds was treated as though it was associated with a single spending authority,
even though actually spending funds from this pool might involve creating signatures with multiple distinct transparent spending keys.
The RPC method `getnewaddress` produced new keys internally via derivation from system randomness, and so these keys had to
be backed up independently even though the wallet did not make distinctions between them visible to the user of `zcashd`.
Similarly, the `getbalance` RPC method treated funds spendable by these independent keys uniformly, as did the other Bitcoin-inherited methods.

When `zcashd` introduced the Sprout, and later the Sapling protocols, it diverged from this original design
by treating each Sprout and Sapling address in the wallet as being associated with an independent spending authority
tied to the address. With Sprout, keys continued to be derived from system randomness, but Sapling introduced a new hierarchical
derivation mechanism, similar to that defined in BIPs 32, 43 and 44. Instead of deriving keys from randomness,
Sapling keys were all derived from a single binary seed value.

As part of introducing the Sprout transfer protocol `zcashd` introduced a few new RPC methods, most
importantly `z_getbalance` and `z_sendmany` which reflected the choice to treat separate addresses
as holding independent balances, and these semantics were retained when the Sapling protocol was added.
However, in the process, a conceptual error was introduced.

With the introduction of `z_getbalance` and `z_sendmany`, it became possible for users to begin treating separate transparent addresses
in the wallet as having independent balances, even though the Bitcoin-derived RPC methods treated those balances as simply being
part of a larger undifferentiated pool of funds. Over the intervening years, users have come to depend upon this inadvertent semantic
change.

## Serialization framework overview

Bitcoind (and zcashd, by extension) employs a custom serialization framework to encode both `Key` and `Value` fields.
This framework handles type-specific serialization, compact sizes, optional fields, and more.
See the [serialization reference](#serialization-reference) for details on how each type is serialized.
Also check out [the Bitcoin Core Onboarding's wallet database section](https://bitcoincore.academy/wallet-database.html).

Data is stored in `dat` files, which are implemented as a BerkeleyDB[^1]. Each entry is serialized using the following structure:

```
<keyname_length><keyname><key>
<value>
```

Where:

- `<keyname_length>` is a byte representing the length of `<keyname>`.
- `<keyname>` is an ASCII encoded string of the length `<keyname_length>` and `<key>` the binary data.
- `<key>` is the output of the serialization of each `Key`.
- `<value>` is the output of the serialization of each `Value`.

Each key and value has an associated C++ class (and sometimes a Rust struct, depending on the version) from [zcashd](https://github.com/zcash/zcash).
Check **[this table](#serialization-reference)** to learn more about how each class is serialized.

## Serialization of Key/Value pairs by version

What value/pair is serialized is taken from [this walletdb.cpp file](https://github.com/zcash/zcash/blob/master/src/wallet/walletdb.cpp).

The following key-values can be found: the property names in bold mean only one instance of this type can exist in the entire database,
while the others, suffixed by '\*' can have multiple instances. `key` and `value` columns of the table contain the types that the stored data is representing.

## Serialization reference

### Common data types

Note on signed integer serialization: All signed integers are serialized using **two's complement** representation.
This format is standard for representing signed numbers in binary and is compatible with the little-endian encoding used throughout the bitcoind/zcashd serialization framework.

| Data Type                                                             | Description                                                                                                                       | Serialized as                                                                                                                       |

## Encryption

Private key encryption is done based on a CMasterKey, which holds a salt and random encryption key.

CMasterKeys are encrypted using AES-256-CBC[^4] using a key derived using derivation method nDerivationMethod
(0 == EVP_sha512()) and derivation iterations nDeriveIterations. vchOtherDerivationParameters is provided
for alternative algorithms which may require more parameters (such as scrypt).

Wallet Private Keys are then encrypted using AES-256-CBC with the double-sha256 of the
public key as the IV, and the master key's key as the encryption key.

## Wallet versions

The following specifies the client version numbers for particular wallet features:

```cpp
enum WalletFeature
{
    FEATURE_BASE = 10500, // the earliest version new wallets supports (only useful for getinfo's clientversion output)

    FEATURE_WALLETCRYPT = 40000, // wallet encryption
    FEATURE_COMPRPUBKEY = 60000, // compressed public keys

    FEATURE_LATEST = 60000
};
```

## Languages

```cpp
// These must match src/rust/src/zip339_ffi.rs.
// (They happen to also match the integer values correspond in the bip0039-rs crate with the
// "all-languages" feature enabled, but that's not required.)
enum Language
{
    English = 0,
    SimplifiedChinese = 1,
    TraditionalChinese = 2,
    Czech = 3,
    French = 4,
    Italian = 5,
    Japanese = 6,
    Korean = 7,
    Portuguese = 8,
    Spanish = 9,
    SIZE_HACK = 0xFFFFFFFF // needed when compiling as C
};
```
