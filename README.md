# Zcash Wallet Formats

This repository tracks the progress of a survey on wallet export formats, with an emphasis on zcashd and zecwallet.

Some work related to parsing is being done the [bdb-parser (outdated)](https://github.com/dorianvp/zcashd-bdb-parser)
and in [the universal wallet parser](https://github.com/dorianvp/uzw-parser).

Check out the Zcashd survey [here](./zcashd/README.md)
